# quantum_visualizer_qubits
The state is randomly chosen based on the distribution of probabilities derived from the random coefficients.
Each quantum state corresponds to a binary representation, allowing us to explore quantum computational concepts such as superposition and entanglement.
Main target is understanding the probabilistic nature of quantum systems.
